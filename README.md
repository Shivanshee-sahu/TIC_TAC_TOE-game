# TIC_TAC_TOE-game
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game built using React. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid until one player wins by getting three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or until the grid is full, resulting in a draw.
